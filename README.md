# Machine-Learning-and-Computational-Physics


## Getting started with Python and TensorFlow
### This assignment is intended to direct students to the necessary resources and
tutorials about programming concepts that will be used in this course. While
some of you might have prior experience of coding with Python (and its libraries
such as Numpy, TensorFlow etc.), you are highly encouraged to go through the
material to revise various concepts.

#### 1 Python basics, NumPy and plotting
#### (a) https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/ (recommended).
#### (b) https://www.w3schools.com/python/ (optional).
#### (c) https://pythonprogramming.net/matplotlib-python-3-basics-tutorial/ (optional).
2 Basics of TensorFlow and Keras
(a) The beginners tutorial at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials (recommended).
(b) https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-python-tensorflowkeras/ (optional).
Google Colaboratory
We will be using Google Colab for all programming assignments. Colab is basically a combination of Jupyter notebook and Google Drive. The attractive
thing about Colab is that it comes preinstalled with many useful packages (like
TensorFlow, NumPy etc.), so everyone can use it without worrying about installing correct version and dependencies. Furthermore, it runs entirely on the 
cloud and can be launched and used directly through the web browser. Best of
all it gives free access to powerful GPUs and TPUs.
If you’re interested in learning more about Google Colab, then we encourage
you to look at following resources:
• Getting started with Google Colab
• Overview of basic Colab features
In order to use Google Colab one needs to have a Google account and an
associated Google Drive. As part of this course, we recommend everyone to
use your USC Google account (which comes with Google Drive) and connect to
Google Colab. We recommend that you start using Colab from this assignment
to get yourself familiar with its workflow.
Few quick notes about Colab and best practices: resources are not
always guaranteed and one might not always get top-notch computing resources
(this is the price of being free). However, it will always be more than sufficient
for all the programming assignments that we will be doing during this course.
If your session is idle for a certain time or your total connection time exceeds
maximum allowed connection time (∼ 12 hours) in a single session, your Colab
VM will disconnect and any unsaved changes will be lost. So, it is highly
recommended that you frequently save your progress. Any request for deadline
extension or grade reconsideration for lost work due to unsaved changes will not
be entertained. To lean more about resource limitations in Colab, please check
