#### Google Colaboratory
 Colab is basically a combination of Jupyter notebook and Google Drive. The attractive --> -->
thing about Colab is that it comes preinstalled with many useful packages (like
TensorFlow, NumPy etc.), so everyone can use it without worrying about installing correct version and dependencies. Furthermore, it runs entirely on the 
cloud and can be launched and used directly through the web browser. Best of
all it gives free access to powerful GPUs and TPUs.
If you’re interested in learning more about Google Colab, then we encourage
you to look at following resources:
• Getting started with Google Colab
• Overview of basic Colab features

> In order to use Google Colab one needs to have a Google account and an
associated Google Drive. As part of this course, we recommend everyone to
use your USC Google account (which comes with Google Drive) and connect to
Google Colab. We recommend that you start using Colab from this assignment
to get yourself familiar with its workflow.
